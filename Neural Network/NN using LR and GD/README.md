The Model predicts the output of the AND gate

Model description:
2 input nodes (Because of 2 input features)
4 hidden nodes
1 output node (Because AND gate gives only 1 output)

The reason for such a high percent of error is because the data size is really small and on such a small dataset with the output being between 2 choices i.e. Binary, Logistic Regression works the best.

Weights are randomized and Bias are initially set to 0
Dataset is pre-inputted
The learning rate and number of times the model should learn is user-inputter
X and Y for predicting is user-inputted
